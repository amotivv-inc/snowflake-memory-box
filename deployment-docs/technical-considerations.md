# Technical Considerations

This document outlines key technical considerations for deploying Memory Box on Snowflake, including infrastructure planning, security requirements, performance optimization, and operational best practices.

## Infrastructure Planning

### Snowflake Account Requirements

**SPCS Prerequisites**
- Snowflake Enterprise Edition or higher
- SPCS feature enabled on account
- Sufficient compute credits for container workloads
- Cross-region Cortex AI access (if using advanced models)

**Resource Planning**
```yaml
Minimum Requirements:
  Frontend Pool: 1 x CPU_X64_XS node
  Backend Pool: 1 x CPU_X64_S node
  Storage: 10GB for initial Memory Box data
  Network: Standard Snowflake networking

Recommended Production:
  Frontend Pool: 2-3 x CPU_X64_XS nodes
  Backend Pool: 2-5 x CPU_X64_S nodes
  Storage: 100GB+ for enterprise Memory Box usage
  Network: Private connectivity for enhanced security
```

### Compute Pool Sizing

**Frontend Pool Considerations**

- **Geographic Distribution** - Consider multiple pools for global deployments

**Backend Pool Considerations**
- **CPU_X64_S** - Required for Memory Box vector operations and Snowflake connectivity
- **Memory Requirements** - 2-4GB per instance for optimal Memory Box performance
- **Scaling Strategy** - Scale based on analytical workload and Memory Box operations
- **Performance Monitoring** - Monitor CPU and memory utilization for optimization

### Storage Architecture

**Memory Box Storage Design**
```sql
-- Optimized table structure for enterprise scale
CREATE TABLE MEMORIES (
    memory_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    content STRING NOT NULL,
    content_type STRING NOT NULL,
    embedding VECTOR(FLOAT, 768) NOT NULL,
    owner_user STRING NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
    access_level STRING NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PRIVATE',
    created_at TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    source_database STRING,
    source_query STRING,
    tags ARRAY,
    metadata OBJECT,
    -- Clustering for performance
    CLUSTER BY (owner_user, created_at)
);
```

**Storage Optimization**
- **Clustering Keys** - Optimize for user-based and temporal access patterns

    VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY(
        embedding, 
        SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EMBED_TEXT_768(?)
    ) as similarity_score,
    created_at
FROM MEMORIES
