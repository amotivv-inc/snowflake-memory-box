# Enterprise Deployment Models

Memory Box on Snowflake supports three enterprise deployment models, each designed for different organizational needs and security requirements. All models leverage Snowpark Container Services (SPCS) for secure, scalable deployment within your Snowflake environment.

## Overview of Deployment Models

| Model | Target Customer | Authentication | Deployment | Management | Status |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Customer Self-Deploy** | Large Enterprise | Snowflake OAuth + SSO | Customer SPCS | Customer Managed | âœ… Production Ready |
| **Managed Service** | Mid-Market | Service Account + Validation | Hosted SPCS | Professionally Managed | âœ… Production Ready |
| **Native App** | All Customers | Native App Permissions | Marketplace | Snowflake Managed | ðŸ“‹ Roadmap |

## Model A: Customer Self-Deploy

### Target Profile
- **Organization Size**: Large enterprises (1000+ employees)
- **Snowflake Maturity**: Advanced users with existing governance frameworks
- **Security Requirements**: Strict data governance and compliance requirements
- **IT Resources**: Dedicated Snowflake administrators and security teams

### Key Characteristics

**Authentication & Security**
- Integrates seamlessly with your existing Snowflake OAuth infrastructure
- Leverages your corporate SSO (SAML, OIDC) for user authentication
- Inherits all existing security policies, MFA requirements, and access controls
- Complete audit trail through your existing Snowflake audit logging

## Choosing the Right Model

### Decision Framework

**Choose Customer Self-Deploy if:**
- Large enterprise with dedicated Snowflake team
- Strict security and compliance requirements
- Need full control over deployment and configuration
- Have existing Snowflake OAuth and SSO infrastructure
- Want to leverage existing operational procedures

**Choose Managed Service if:**
- Mid-market organization with limited Snowflake admin resources
- Want rapid deployment without infrastructure management
- Prefer predictable subscription-based pricing
- Need professional security management and support
- Want to focus on analytics rather than platform management

**Choose Native App (when available) if:**
- Want simplest possible installation and management
- Prefer marketplace-based software distribution
- Need seamless Snowsight integration
- Want automatic updates and platform evolution
- Have standard security requirements

### Migration Paths

**Managed Service â†’ Customer Self-Deploy**
Organizations can start with Managed Service for rapid value realization, then migrate to Customer Self-Deploy as their Snowflake expertise grows.

**Native App â†’ Customer Self-Deploy**
Future Native App users can migrate to Customer Self-Deploy for enhanced control and customization.

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
All deployment models ensure:
- Memory Box data never leaves your Snowflake environment
- Encryption at rest and in transit through Snowflake's native capabilities
- Access controls through Snowflake's proven RBAC system
- Complete audit trails for compliance and governance

### Authentication Security
Each model provides enterprise-grade authentication:
- **Customer Self-Deploy**: Leverages existing enterprise SSO and OAuth
